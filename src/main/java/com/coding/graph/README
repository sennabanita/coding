Topological sort: 
wiki: A topological ordering is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.
1. Topological sort Kahn's algo
2. DFS based algo

Shortest Path Algorithms:
Single source shortest path:
1. Using topological ordering, work for -ve and +ve weight O(V+E)
2. Dijkstra: Single source to all node shortest path - works only for +ve edges
   a. With binary heap O((V+E) logV)
   b. With binary indexed heap
   c. With D-ary heap
3. Bellman ford O(VE) - can handle -ve weights and detect -ve cycle in the graph
All Pair shortest path
1. Floyd Warshall O(n3)
